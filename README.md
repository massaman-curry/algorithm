# About this repository

This repository is to record my challenges of Atcoder. I began to learn algorithms since December 2019. Through this challenges, I want to improve my coding skills. 

I believe there's no shortcut to become a good programmer, I want to keep on learning and coding. I don't know how many of grass I have in the end of 2020, but I try to do my best!
